# Python-Calculator
a calculator made using Python.

As of now this project supports the following:
- Basic math (+, -, *, /, %)
- The use of parentheses
- Raising something to the nth power, this uses ^ as the operator and raises whatever is before the operator to the power of what comes after, this may be applied to parentheses.
 note: empty parentheses will simply be removed.
- The nth root, this uses \ as the operator and takes the 'what comes before the operator'th root of whatever comes after the operator, this may be applied to parentheses.
- the special numbers pi and e, they work by just typing them in. (e, pi)
- sine, cosine and tangent. they also work by simply typing them, f.e. **sin(number)**.
