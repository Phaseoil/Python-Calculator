# Python-Calculator
a calculator made using Python.

As of now this project supports the following operations:
- Basic math (+, -, *, /, %)
- The use of parentheses
- Raising something to the nth power, this uses ^ as the operator and raises whatever is before the operator to the power of what comes after, this works in parentheses.
- The nth root, this uses \ as the operator and takes the 'what comes after the operator'th root of whatever comes before the operator, this works on parentheses.
