a calculator made using Python.

as of now this project supports the following operations:
- basic math (+, -, *, /, %)
- the use of parentheses
- raising something to the nth power, this uses ^ as the operator and raises whatever is before the operator to the power of what comes after, this works on parentheses.
- the nth root, this uses \ as the operator and takes the 'whatcomesafter the opertor'th root of whatever comes before the operator, this works on parentheses.
